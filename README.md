Microservice application
=================================
I want to familiarize myself with a) scala b) multi-project sbt for micro services

# Problems I face

I want to combine a frontend: play with some backend services AKKA.

 - The main class cannot be found - even if I navigate into the correct sub-module.
 - The dependencies are not resolved, even though they seem to be defined correctly.

# To run
To run a single module / service
```
frontend/run
```

# to deploy
